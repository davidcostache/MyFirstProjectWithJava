# My First Project with Java
This Java application is a straightforward project I developed as my first Java coding experience on the Hyperskill platform. It simulates the financial overview of a sweet shop, tracking earnings from items like bubblegum, toffee, ice cream, and more. The program calculates total income, prompts the user for input on staff and other expenses, and computes net income accordingly. This project has been an excellent introduction to Java programming, helping me understand the basics of variable handling, user input, and simple arithmetic operations in a real-world application context.
